The entire design of the project went through 3 phases. These phases are:

the Desktop design phase
the Mobile design phase and
the Tablet design phase.

Throughout all the three design phases, the entire website was envisioned as having 3 main parts or main divs.

The nav tag was used to group the logo image and the first 'pre-order' button.
The nav tag was assigned a display property of flex.

The first main div encompasses the first block text which includes the H1 and the paragrag beneath which is also in its own 
div tag, in addition to the first keyboard image which also has its own div.
This first main div tag was given a class name of "first-row".
The first text block within the "first-row" class also has a class name "first-block" which allows that entire dive to be styled separately.
The second div with the same "first-row" div has a id name "first-row-imag-div" which allows the div containing the image to be style.
The "first-row" class was then given a margin-bottom property to provide space between that section and the next section.

The second main div contains the two other images and the second text block which has the h2 header.
The name assigned to this section of the HTML page was given a class name of "second-row".
The main second-row class contains sub-divs which were also included to help specify two main groups to allow stylyin.
The first sub-div within the second-row class was given the name "second-rown-images" which contained the two images in the second row. namely: the 'phone-and-keyboard' image and the 'keyboard-and-glass' image.
The images were assigned the desired heights and widths within the css stylesheet.

The background color of the HTML page was left at the default which is #FFFFFF.
The font-family 'Barlow' was imported into the HTML file from the Google Fonts webpage.

All H1 headers were given a font-size of 56 pixels.
All H1 headers were assigned a line-height of 56pixels also.

All H2 headers were given a font-size of 32 pixels.
All H2 headers were given a line-height of 36 pixels.

All H3 headers were given a font-size of 24 pixels.
All H3 headers were given a line-height of 28 pixels.

All headers were transformed to uppercase elements by using the text-transform property in CSS.

All texts within buttons were were aligned in the center and were also transformed using the text-transform property.

The top right button was given a default background color of #E8EFF2. But was given an active color of #162542.
The second button was given a default background color of #F16718. But was also given an active color of #FF9B62.
Both buttons were given an active text color of #FFFFFF.
